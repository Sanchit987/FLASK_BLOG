# My experience with flask

###### My three day experince with pythonâ€™s flask framework was awesome I was not focused at completeing the project but was rather interested in doing experiments.I learned various new things while reading the documentation of flask.I was never interested in doing web development but after experimenting on flask i got in love with it.I would not say it is simple but i can say that it is interesting.I tried to create my own project using flask.I created different version of the project using git, frankly speaking i was not able to create a working project because i was new with web development and was not familiar with Html or any other language i struck at the place where i was experimenting with forms(html).I tried many times to correct the error but failed I am definately going to disscuss the problem with my seniors who are helpful and will guide me to solve the problem. I generated a lot of errors and learned new things. i would like to conclude by saying that web development is interesting and one should definately learn it.
